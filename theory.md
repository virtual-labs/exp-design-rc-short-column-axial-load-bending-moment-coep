## Design a reinforced concrete (RC) short column subjected to an axial load
### Theory :
Short columns are RC columns whose slenderness ratio (ratio of effective length to least lateral dimension) is less than a certain limit defined by building codes (typically around 12). Due to their stubby nature, their behavior is primarily governed by axial compression rather than bending.
The design process involves:
•	Material Properties: Considering the characteristic compressive strength of concrete (fck) and characteristic yield strength of steel reinforcement (fy).
•	Equilibrium: Balancing the applied axial load (Pu) with the resisting forces provided by the concrete and steel.
•	Strength Analysis: Using code-specified equations to determine the required area of steel reinforcement (Asc) to ensure the column can resist the applied load without failure.

##### Design Steps :
1.  Define Design Parameters:
Specify the applied axial load (Pu) on the column.
Choose design values for concrete strength (fck) and steel yield strength (fy) based on material specifications and code requirements.
Select a desired concrete cover thickness for durability (refer to building codes).
2.	Determine Column Dimensions:
Considering architectural constraints and spacing requirements, choose a preliminary rectangular or square cross-section for the column (b x h).
Check code provisions for minimum column dimensions.
3.	Effective Length Calculation:
Based on the end support conditions (fixed, hinged, etc.), calculate the effective length (Le) of the column using code formulas.
4.	Slenderness Ratio Check:
Calculate the slenderness ratio (Le/b) for the chosen dimensions.
Verify the slenderness ratio is less than the code limit for short column design.
5.	Minimum Reinforcement Ratio:
Determine the minimum required area of steel reinforcement (Asc,min) based on code provisions and concrete strength.
6.	Strength Design:
Assume a trial reinforcement ratio within the allowed limits (typically 0.01 to 0.08).
Use code equations to calculate the resisting capacity of the reinforced concrete section (Pu, capacity).
If Pu, capacity is less than the applied load (Pu), adjust the reinforcement ratio and repeat the calculation until a safe design is achieved (Pu, capacity >= Pu).
7.	Serviceability Check:
Depending on the code and project requirements, perform calculations to ensure the column deflection under service loads (including dead load) is within acceptable limits.
8.	Reinforcement Details:
Determine the number and diameter of longitudinal steel bars required to achieve the calculated area of reinforcement (Asc).
Design and specify the spacing, diameter, and minimum requirements for lateral ties to ensure confinement of concrete and prevent buckling of steel bars.
9.	Code Compliance Check:
Verify the final design meets all relevant code requirements for concrete cover, minimum bar spacing, fire resistance, etc.
